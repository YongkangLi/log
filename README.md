Personal Daily Log

## Day 1 - 2020. 10. 22
1. Tried to run modified xv6 [(xv6-k210)](https://github.com/SKTT1Ryze/xv6-k210) on Maix Bit (k210).
2. A little bit forward push on xv6: pagetables and virtual memory management.
3. Modern Operating System: process and thread management.
4. Algorithm: Network Flow.
5. Rdt lab finally ended!!
6. Oops, prepare for the test on Saturday, only 2 days left. Pray for myself.

## Day 2 - 2020. 10. 23
1. Tested the pagetable of [xv6-k210](https://github.com/SKTT1Ryze/xv6-k210) on Maix Bit (k210).
2. Learned how to commit a pr and collaborate on github (hhh).
3. Implemented Merkle Tree to test the consistency and fault-tolerance of distributed file systems.
4. Operating System: how to avoid and solve deadlock.
5. Review for test on Saturday.

## Day 3 - 2020. 10. 24
1. Took the exam, probably could pass (hope so).
2. Improvement on Merkle Tree implementation (Review Data Structure, hhh).
3. Configured hadoop developing environment on Windows. THANKS to many of my classmates and friends.
4. My first java project, such a regret.
5. Apprecaite my ... (how to say) maybe godder ??? (LOL)

## Day 4 - 2020. 10. 25
1. Meet one of my firends in the morning. An idle relexation.
2. Debug the MapReduce Job on HDFS.
3. xv6: Process Management.

## Day 5 - 2020. 10. 26
1. Algorithm: a tricky matching problem (under some certain Circumstances, greedy strategy is much easier and more effective than dynamic programming, LOL).
2. Tried to run a simple process on xv6-k210, but failed. The problem is that I didn't quiet figure out the details of the procedure after ```procinit```. So I had no idea what happened and where the bug lies.
3. Thinking about the difference between kernel and user process. I wonder whether kernel is just a normal process running under M mode and direct mapped pagetable. Another confusion is that whether kernel is continuously running on CPU. If so, how does a computer with single core run kernel. If not, how does kernel work. etc...
4. Searched for the answer for above questions, which is still confounding me. Maybe I need to read more related material to make it clear.

## Day 6 - 2020. 10. 27
1. Operating System: to transplant xv6 on k210 better, I learned several basic scheduling machineries, such as FIFO, Shortest Time First, Mutil-Level Preference and time-slice, etc.
2. xv6: understood system calls, exception and interrupt more profoundly. More insight to its implementation.
3. Read xv6 source code to figure out how to implement process management. A little bit confusing. So I will continue reading tomorrow.
4. Debugging MapReduce desperately.
 
## Day 7 - 2020. 10. 28
1. CPT Lab finally ended, such a relief!
2. Last lecture of a course professed by one of my faverite professors. A little bit upset. Begin reviewing next Monday!!!
3. Wasted time on mapreduce once again, such a sad story.

## Day 8 - 2020. 10. 29
1. Algorithm: further insight into Network Flow, its application and some collaries.
2. Virtualization on RISC-V: presentations given by several Graduate. Learned more about gem5, xvisor and SBI.
3. Started CPU Lab, finished one third (3 Level Time Sequence).

## Day 9 - 2020. 10. 30
1. Last Lecture of Numerical Analysis. Have to start another plan for reviewing.
2. OS Lecture: general tasks done by memory management, vitual address and virtual address space.
3. CPU Lab, another half done (Modern Time Sequence).
4. Big Data Processing: MapReduce and Merkle Tree. Completely OVER!!!

## Day 10 - 2020. 10. 31
1. Finished last part of CPU Lab - Interrupt!!!
2. OS Lab: mutual-exclusion and synchronization between multi-threads and multi-processes.
3. Had dinner with my parents. My last dinner with them was on National Day, which is nearly a month ago. Shame on Me.

## Day 11 - 2020. 11. 01
1. Finished OS Lab - process, thread and file system. Nothing much.
